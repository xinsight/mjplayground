### High-Level Goals for the Playground Redesign:

* more efficient use of space (zones)
* promote concepts of: learning/interaction/making/growing
* create more shade
* address any safety issues
* encourage all-year/all-season outdoor play

### Deliverables:
1. modest improvements to existing playground (Spring 2018)
2. Full design for a new playground (Spring/Summer 2018)

### Action Items:

- How to get all the teachers in a room to discuss? (Matthew)

- Need a vision for the playground (to get staff on board, for fundraising)

- In preparation of the redesign, brainstorm and research options (from other playgrounds, pedagogy, literature, etc.) (all committee members)

Initial ideas for playground elements (as a starting point for discussion):

- garden (e.g. raised bed)
- moving water
- rain barrel
- seasonal activities (e.g. making ice)
- permanent tables (work areas)
- climbing
- balancing (e.g. balance beam)
- building (blocks, wood, etc.)
- sticks
- hill
- slide
- bridge
- tunnel
- play house
- chalk board
