# PLAYGROUND WORKSHOP REFLECTIONS

## 2018-01-30

### SURPRISES
- teachers were extremely positive and open to new ideas

- nature was a strong theme
  - "i love the trees that we have."
  - "we need more nature"
  - enthusiasm for a garden

- no major concerns about waster/mud/dirt
  - (only comment about dirt was wood chips being mucky in the winter and dusty in the summer)

- interest in a quiet "cozy corner"
  - and open to the idea that play wasn't all about exercise

- rain shelter was something that would be useful and give the playground a higher score

- no issues with the patio stones (other than they need leveling in places)

- back corner with trees is dead space - not really used

### IDEAS (from the workshop)

- one large shed instead of 2 smaller ones (?why is this better?)

- cozy corner
  - logs to sit on
  - "some kids like to have some downtime. read a book…"
  - "some want to sit, relax in the shade"

- multi-level climbing element
  - older kids can be challenged with climbing and can go on top
  - toddlers can use enclosed space underneath (with benches/seating)

- science area
  - scale for weighing
  - funnels for pouring into containers
  - table to work on

- water wall (?)
  - ? only mentioned in one presentation… but i don't know how what they envisioned ?

- table for a picnic
  - "just to put stuff on"


### ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
- sandbox (with a kitchen/table)
- some hard surface (for trucks, tricycles)
- storage shed
- logs/stumps/balance beams


### HARD PROBLEMS

- How to keep animals out of the sandbox? (mesh doesn't keep it clean, wood is heavy…)

- How to add challenging elements for older kids, yet keep them inaccessible to the toddlers?

### LOW HANGING FRUIT

- electrical outlet (4-5' high)

- teacher shelf (for keys, phones, pens, etc.)

- small wheelbarrow (not plastic)

- more sand toys? (funnels, tubes for pouring sand)

- remove black plastic border around play structure (at least on the south side) and complete tricycle circle

- benches (logs?) (to replace existing wobbly, junk benches)

- sound wall (old pots, pans etc.)

### ACTION ITEMS

1) review past playground reports (from city? public health?) and summarize suggestions, and areas where full points were not granted (is the gate not up to the current standards?)

2) research if there are requirements for soil in a daycare playground (for vegetable or herb garden)

3) research rubber surfacing options (cost per sq ft? preparation? drainage concerns? edging with dirt/sand/wood chips?)

4) research inexpensive sources of trees for stumps, tables, benches, etc.

5) inventory # of tricycles and storage space required. (1 shed is all tricycles - can it be optimized?)

6) research feasibility/cost of building a small hill (to be integrated with a tunnel or slide)

7) Followup with teachers on why one larger shed is better than two? And for details on the "water wall" idea.
