# MATTHEW-JOHN PLAYGROUND

## WHAT IS THIS?
This page is a collection/archive/brain-dump of information relating to the playground at the Matthew John Playground Centre. (If anyone stumbles across this that isn't aware, MJDCC is a parent-run daycare in Toronto, Canada.)

## BACKGROUND
A new playground committee was formed after the 2017 AGM. The goal was to refresh the existing playground which was over 20 years old. The playground also lacked shade as a mature tree in the yard to the west of the playground was removed.

## ACTIVITY (2017-2018)

### STAFF WORKSHOP

- gather feedback from staff about what works with the current playground and what could be improved

### BOARD PRESENTATION
15 Feb 2018

After we were quoted over $140k for a playground build, we decided to step back and look for some inexpensive improvements.

### New Tree
An Autumn Blaze Maple (80mm Ã¸) was planted on the west side of the playground to provide shade, introduce more natural elements into the playground.

The tree was 28 Jun 2018 by Upandoak Tree Care and has a 2-year warranty.

A 100' hose was purchased to help with watering the tree. And a watering schedule was posted.
