# MATTHEW-JOHN PLAYGROUND

## WHAT IS THIS?
This page is a collection/archive/brain-dump of information relating to the playground at the Matthew John Playground Centre. (If anyone stumbles across this that isn't aware, MJDCC is a parent-run daycare in Toronto, Canada.)

## BACKGROUND
A new playground committee was formed after the 2017 AGM. The goal was to refresh the existing playground which was over 20 years old. The playground also lacked shade as a mature tree in the yard to the west of the playground was removed.

## ACTIVITY (2017-2018)

### STAFF WORKSHOP

- gather feedback from staff about what works with the current playground and what could be improved

### BOARD PRESENTATION
15 Feb 2018

Presentation to the board including the results of the staff workshop, and next steps.

### SHORT-TERM IMPROVMENTS
29 Apr 2018

After we were quoted over $140k for a playground build, we decided to step back and look for some inexpensive improvements.

### PARENT WORK EVENT 1

An intensive cleanup of the playground (e.g. removed excess dirt/sand/dust, removed broken items from the storage shed) and installed a 6x6 post for a shade sail over the sandbox.

### PARENT WORK EVENT 2
23-24 Jun 2018

Removed old sand, moved the sandbox away from the wall, and replaced the sand with high-quality granite sand.

### New Tree
28 Jun 2018

An Autumn Blaze Maple (80mm Ã¸) was planted on the west side of the playground to provide shade, introduce more natural elements into the playground.

The tree was planted by Upanoak Tree Care and has a 2-year warranty.

A 100' hose was purchased to help with watering the tree, and a watering schedule was posted. The tree needs to be watered twice a week for the first season and then once a week in 2019.

### Nature area

- create soft landscaping area by remove stones in west end of playground
- add playground-certified fibre mulch (15-20cm)
- fibre mulch mats with use to create a soft "carpet"

### Planters
 - built with cedar 4x4's or a half-barrel planter
 - many plant options: flowers (for butterflies), bamboo, vegetables

### Rain barrel
 - goes well with planters
 - rain barrel could use the downspout from the rectory
 - barrel needs to have a filter at the top to prevent insects
 - barrel needs to be attached to the building to prevent it from tipping over

### Benches
- reuse the logs from the felled tree branch
- Logs can be sawed flat, or left as-is with bark
  - all sharp edges sanded down with a belt sander
  - logs need to be secured to prevent rolling
  - log can be notched on both sides and a split log (or 4x4) can be placed in a notch and screwed in
