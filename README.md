# MATTHEW-JOHN PLAYGROUND

## WHAT IS THIS?
This page is a collection/archive/brain-dump of information relating to the playground at the Matthew John Playground Centre. (If anyone stumbles across this that isn't aware, MJDCC is a parent-run daycare in Toronto, Canada.)

## BACKGROUND
A new playground committee was formed after the 2017 AGM. The goal was to refresh the existing playground which was over 20 years old. The playground also lacked shade as a mature tree in the yard to the west of the playground was removed.

## ACTIVITY (2017-2018)

### STAFF WORKSHOP

- gather feedback from staff about what works with the current playground and what could be improved

### BOARD PRESENTATION

### SHORT-TERM IMPROVMENTS

After we were quoted over $140k for a playground build, we decided to step back and look for some inexpensive improvements.
